rusty is an effot to learn and build a code-editor that works well and is performant, this is a start, i am not that familiar with rust so yes there is help from different llm's.
rusty is terminal based atleast until there is not a huge benefit seen to shift to its own ui.
rusty is to share with everyone so others can learn and contribute if they want.
also let me know if you would like to see any other features built into rusty and all suggestions and plase also let me know all the things wrong, thank you.
