rusty is an effot to learn and build a code-editor that works well and is performant, this is a start, i am not that familiar with rust so yes there is help from different llm's.
rusty is terminal based atleast until there is not a huge benefit seen to shift to its own ui.
rusty is to share with everyone so others can learn and contribute if they want.
